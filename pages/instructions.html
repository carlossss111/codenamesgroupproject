        <h1>How to play</h1>
        <p>The game is split between two teams, red and blue, over a 5x5 board of word cards and the objective is to be the first to get to 9 points. Each team has a spy and a spymaster.</p>
        <p>Picking one of a team's card will add 1 point to that team. Picking a "neutral" card (card in brown) will not add any point. Picking a "bomb" card (card in black) or the timer runs out will end the game and your team loses.</p>

        <h2>Spymaster</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You will see the team-colour of every card on the board.</li>
            <li>Enter a clue word that relates to a number of cards on the board. (Try to make it related to your team's cards rather than other cards)</li>
            <li>The clue cannot be the same as a word on the board.</li>
            <li>Enter the number of related cards and now it becomes your spy's turn.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="space">The spymaster's board looks like this:</p>
        <span>
            <img src="../rsc/images/spymaster_screen.png"/>
        </span>

        <h2>Spy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You will get a board without team-colours. You will get the spymaster's word clue and number of related cards.</li>
            <li>Pick the right cards relating to the word clue.</li>
            <li>e.g. If you get the clue "ocean-2" then the 2 cards "surf" and "water" might be correct.</li>
            <li>Your turn ends and the other team's turn begins when you either find a given number of correct cards or pick a card not belonging to your team.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="space">The spy's board looks like this:</p>
